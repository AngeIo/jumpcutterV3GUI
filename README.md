# JumpCutterV3GUI
Automatically cuts silent sections of videos - Originally inspired by carykh.

You can select an entire folder at once for a batch of videos (probably lectures tbh) or select an individual file to process - now with a much more efficient encoding process than the original version released by Carykh, and cutting processing times by over 90% for files over an hour long! 

Set the values for how fast you want silent parts of your lecture to be, what the threshold is for "quiet speech" and how long pauses have to be before the program starts speeding that section up - more detailed explanations of these values can be found in the [arguments](#arguments) section.

# Windows Setup (GUI)
[JumpCutter_AIO.exe](https://github.com/seaty6/jumpcutterV2/releases/latest/download/JumpCutter_AIO.exe)

The above is simply JumpCutter_AIO.py compiled with pyinstaller - it should work on Windows without having to install Python, but you will have to install ffmpeg. The easiest way to do this is to install chocolatey and let it do the work for you.
From an administrative command prompt:

```@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command " [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"```

Close, then reopen the Administrative command prompt, and run:

`choco install ffmpeg`

And you're done! You can now run the executable. You may have to install a codec pack depending on the file format you're trying to convert. CCCP and K-lite Basic have been tested and are confirmed working - you can install CCCP from [Ninite]([https://ninite.com/cccp/](https://ninite.com/cccp/)), the official [CCCP website]([http://www.cccp-project.net/](http://www.cccp-project.net/)), or  with the following command in an Administrative Command Prompt:

```choco install cccp```

Check [usage](#usage ) for further instructions if you're having issues. 

# Windows Setup (CLI)
 [fast_video.exe](https://github.com/seaty6/jumpcutterV2/releases/latest/download/fast_video.exe)

Everything is the same except for the file - get this one instead, and run ```fast_video.exe -h``` to get a list of all the parameters. 



# Python Setup (GUI)
1. Download ```arraywav.py``` and ```jumpcutterGUI_AIO.py``` to the same folder
2. Ensure that a 64bit version of Python is installed and in use ([Python download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

    > Note: You can check this by running `python -c "import struct; print(struct.calcsize('P')*8)"`. Should return `64`.

3. Using pip, install the modules in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/seaty6/jumpcutterV2/releases/latest/download/requirements.txt)
4. Install ffmpeg and add it to PATH ([ffmpeg download](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and a [Guide](https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/))
5. Run ```python jumpcutterGUI_AIO.py```.
6. Done.

5. Refer to the [Usage Section](#usage).
6. Done.


# Differences
1. Can no longer specify: sounded_speed, frame_rate, and frame_quality
2. Can't download YouTube videos
3. Doesn't take up a large amount of space by splitting up each frame
4. Goes much faster

# Usage
Windows (GUI):
run ```JumpCutterGui_AIO.exe```

Remember that only one of the two fields (File/Folder location) should be filled, and the other should be blank. One is for doing individual files, and the other is for doing several videos, with in a folder. If using the folder option, be sure that only video files are in the folder. 

Windows (CLI):
`fast_video.exe {video file name} --silentSpeed {float} --silentThreshold {float} --floatMargin {float}`

Python (GUI):
run ```JumpCutterGui_AIO.py```


Python (CLI):
`python3 fast_video.py {video file name} --silentSpeed {float} --silentThreshold {float} --floatMargin {float}`

Using shorts:
`fast_video.exe {video file name} -s {float} -t {float} -m {float}`

> Note: On Linux and Windows, `python3` may not work. Use `python` instead. Alternatively, you could use the executable if on Windows, in the releases tab.

## Argument Values
| Argument | Default Value | Why adjust? |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| `silentSpeed` | 99999 | Lower for less "jump" - This is the speed the video will play when there is no sound. 99999 works for jumpcutting, and 4-5 works better for lectures.|
| `silentThreshold` | 0.04 | Vary between 0-1 for less/more "silence" (Higher values mean more of the video is cut out) |
| `frameMargin` | 1 | Increase by whole numbers to require larger pauses before cutting out a section (If your professor takes breaks between his words, this will prevent cutting every gap between every word. |

# Heads up
Based on Python3

# Credits:
Thanks to [gusals3587](https://github.com/gusals3587/jumpcutterV2) for reworking the code to be much more optimized

Thanks to [WyattBlue](https://github.com/WyattBlue/jumpcutterV2) for adding back the all but the frame_margin parameter


# Notes:
It's important to mention that broswer extensions exist like the one WofWca has made [(Chrome link)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jump-cutter/lmppdpldfpfdlipofacekcfleacbbncp?hl=en)  [(Github Link)](https://github.com/WofWca/jumpcutter) and the one vantezzen has made [(Chrome Link)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skip-silence/fhdmkhbefcbhakffdihhceaklaigdllh?hl=en) [(Github Link)](https://github.com/vantezzen/skip-silence) exist - these browser extensions have jumpier audio, but require no local processing, and can skip on the fly. Depending on your workflow, and tolerance for audio imperfections, this may be an ideal solution.
